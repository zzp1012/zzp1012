I am an undergraduate student majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [UMJI-SJTU](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests range across explainable AI, graph representation learning and game theory. 

Now, I am a undergraduate researcher at [John Hopcroft Center](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU, studying interpretable AI under the supervision of [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/). Before that, from May. 2019 to Aug. 2020, I used to be a research assistant at [OMNILab](http://omnilab.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU, studying knowledge graph under the supervision of [Prof. Yaohui Jin](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276323800). From Sep. 2020 to Jun. 2021, I participated in two research projects and was responsible for leading one project on edge computing at [WangLab](http://wanglab.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Default.aspx), UMJI-SJTU, tutored by [Prof. Xudong Wang](https://wanglab.sjtu.edu.cn/en/content.aspx?info_lb=472&flag=295). From Mar. 2021 to Jun. 2021, I was working on molecule property prediction and knowledge graph reasoning at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/). 

I will pursue my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University after graduation.

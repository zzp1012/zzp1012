I am an undergraduate student majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [UMJI-SJTU](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests range across explainable AI, graph representation learning and game theory. I used to be a research assistant at [OMNILab](http://omnilab.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU, under the supervision of [Prof. Yaohui Jin](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276323800). After that, I joined [John Hopcroft Center](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU, under the supervision of [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/). I am also responsible for leading a research project at [WangLab](http://wanglab.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Default.aspx), UMJI-SJTU, tutored by [Prof. Xudong Wang](https://wanglab.sjtu.edu.cn/en/content.aspx?info_lb=472&flag=295). Recently, I am working as a summer intern at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/).
